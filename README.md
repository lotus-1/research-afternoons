# Research Afternoons

After each week's research presentations, each team has the responsability to push the result of their research to this repo so that each student has access to the information collected by the others.

## How to add your research to this repo

- Go to [](https://github.com/lotus-1/research-afternoons) and click on **Clone or Download**
- Copy the link that you see
- In your terminal, go to the folder where you save all the workshops and Lotus material.
- Create a new directory called `Research`
```
mkdir Research && cd Research
```
- Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/lotus-1/research-afternoons.git 
cd research-afternoons
```
- Checkout from master and create a new branch
- Create all your research files there.
- Once your files are ready to be pushed to Github, push it to your branch.
- In your browser, go back to the repository on Github and create a new Pull Request. You should see a notification that a new branch has been with the option **Compare and Pull Request**, click on it to open a new Pull Request.
- Write a good description of what you are pushing and assign your teamates as well as your lead mentor in the Reviewers section.

And that's it! Your teamates should approve the PR. Once it's approved by all the team, your lead mentor will review it and merge it (or request changes if needed).
